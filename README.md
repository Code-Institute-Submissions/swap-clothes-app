- OS Compatibility was tested on iOS 13.6.1, Android 10.0, MacOS Catalina v10.15.6, iPadOS 13.6.1, and Windows 10 'May 2020 update'. It is yet to be tested on Unix, Linux or Solaris Operating Systems.
- The devices used in this testing include Macbook Pro, Toshiba laptop, iPad Pro, iPhone Xr, Xiaomi 3, HTC 11, iPhone 8, HUAWEI P40 Pro and other android mobile phones.
- The website was exhaustively tested for responsiveness on [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools). Different viewport sizes were simulated ranging from as small as Galaxy Fold (280px) to large desktop sizes (1200px and above).

### Performance Testing
- Overall WebPage Performance Test was done using [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) with test location set to Ireland and test browser set to Chrome. Some areas of improvement according to this website are Security of the site and Cache Static Content which are out of the scope of this particular project, however, I will be looking to improve these in the future.

## Credits

### Code :floppy_disk:
- Most of the code was written by the author - Liga Baikova in jQuery.
- The code in the calculator.js file lines 90 - 101 was provided to me by my mentor Maranatha Ilesanmi. The code refreshes the Calculator page when navigated to and prevent previous entries from saving (caching).
- The 3D models were coded using the Three.js library. Even though I used the docs, examples, and tutorials supplied on their website, there isn't anything quite like my model so even though the 'HOW' was taken from the website, the 'WHAT' was produced by me.
- 3D models were coded in JavaScript rather than jQuery to be consistent with Three.js docs and allow for easier debugging.
- jQuery library and docs were used in most JavaScript files.
- Bootstrap was used in layout coding as well as the navigation, collapsable hamburger menu and the footer.

### Content :book:

- To create the color scheme I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- To write up a README file the most helpful documents were
    - Code Institute [SampleREADME](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME)
    - Code Institute [README Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template)
    - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)
    - [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    - List of [emoji markdown](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)
    - I used the structure of my last projects [README](https://github.com/liigalized/MS1_boredom_guide) file and re-used the write-up elements that were repeated in this project.
- The history of Astronomy content was inspired by[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) and [Sky and Telescope](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/whats-difference-astrology-vs-astronomy/).
- The history of Astrology content was inspired by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology) and [Wtamu](https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/03/23/how-does-astrology-work/).
- The Connection between both fields' content was inspired by [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/astrology-vs-astronomy-whats-the-difference) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology_and_astronomy).
- The content about Zodiac signs was inspired by this [NASA](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/starfinder2/en/) article for kids.
- The content about constellations was inspired by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation).
- The Constellation mapping was done by using the constellation maps from [The Sky](http://www.seasky.org/sky.html). The individual star data was obtained from this website as well.
- The API used in the Zodiac Signs Page is [aztro API](https://rapidapi.com/sameer.kumar/api/aztro) which was found through [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/) website.


### Media :clapper:
- The star icon used as the main page background and with the page buttons was designed and created by me.
- The constellation graphics and zodiac graphics for the graphic buttons were custom designed for this project by a graphic designer [Claire Schorman](https://www.instagram.com/byclaireschorman/).


### Acknowledgements
